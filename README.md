This project has gone mostly untouched since [Christian Metts](https://github.com/mintchaos) and I worked on it back in 2008. One September 11, we made an agreement that I'd buy the domain if he created the wallpaper and the website. That evening we published the website and wallpaper and we haven't looked back. 

The original Pony image was for sale on [iStock](http://www.istockphoto.com/photos/3355498?excludenudity=true&sort=best&mediatype=photography&phrase=3355498) which we purchased a license for. Sadly, the pony is no long for sale by the original author.

The djangopony's short, but legendary existence is thanks to Bryan Veloso who was inspired to seek out and [give life to the djangopony](http://avalonstar.com/journal/2008/the-web-framework-for-ponies/).
